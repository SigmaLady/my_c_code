Here are 20 coding questions for you to solve.

Goal is to get yourself familiar with the syntax and usage of C by solving these problems.

You can understand the "logic" from internet if need to - then use the C language to code it in.

Make sure that you use a self explanatory text for asking user input, and Output should be in a new line.

Use a new file for every coding question. Filename should be 01.c, 02.c .... Likewise - using the question numbers.

Each file should start by writing the actual question as a C comment. Followed by code. 

Use proper variable names, and ensure to put proper comments in code section to tell what that block of code is doing.

IF U HAVE TO TAKE HELP - MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE Code BEFORE COPYING. GOAL IS TO LEARN.
